1. Conduct Toward Myself

                 I will not participate in any drug or tobacco use.

                  I will limit alcohol consumption to no more than 3 drinks in one night.

                  I will choose healthy snacks over processed snacks.

                  I will not put myself down for any reason.

                  I will leave work concerns at work and home concerns at home.

2. Conduct Toward Others

                  I will extend kindness to all others, even when they don’t extend it to me.

                  I will take action to help a person in need if I see their need and am capable of making the situation better.

                  I will respect differences of opinion by acknowledging the other person’s stance and not pushing their acceptance of mine.

3. Conduct in Difficult Situations

                  In a violent situation, I will only retaliate with violence if I am unable to call for or get to help.

                  If a disagreement turns into a negative argument, I will walk away from the situation.
