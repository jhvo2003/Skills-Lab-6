***
Temperature Calculator is a program that successfully takes the user's name and asks the the user the temperature outside. Depending on whether the temperature was inputed as Celsius or Fahrenheit, it returns the converted temperature. For example, if the user inputs 0 degrees Celsius, the program would return the temperature in Fahrenheit, which would be 32.
