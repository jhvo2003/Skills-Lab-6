#Project Temperature Calculator
***
Temperature Calculator is a program that successfully takes the user's name and asks the the user the temperature outside. Depending on whether the temperature was inputed as Celsius or Fahrenheit, it returns the converted temperature. For example, if the user inputs 0 degrees Celsius, the program would return the temperature in Fahrenheit, which would be 32.

##Installation
***
In order to install the program
$ git clone https://github.com/jhvo2003/Skills-Lab-6.git
$ cd ../path/to/the/file
$ npm install
$ npm start

##Collaboration
***
In order to collab on this project or make it your own, follow the first step of "Installation". This should copy the repository onto your code editor with the program. With permission from the owner of the repository, you can edit the program and push the changes into the repository with a pull request.

##LICENSE
***
The unilicense was used for this project as we wanted the program to be an open-source and anyone in the world can use it. The program is very simple and there would be no reason for anyone to misuse the program in anyway. The unilicense allows the program to be used in anyway without any harm done to the user or the collaborators.

##Code of Conduct
***
We chose this code of conduct because since this is a simple program, it is more geared towards young programmers. The code of conduct will teach them the importance of working together and kindness to others with no hostility.

Collaborators: Jason Vo and Liya Zheng
